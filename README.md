## Who I am
Christina Biggs
Data Engineer (HEO) at Defra
Contracted hours: 9.00am-3.00pm
I live in Bristol
Iâ€™m half-Swedish and half-English
## My preferences
I like to use Teams messages when discussing a task as that means I can add comments and findings (and edit them) and they are all on the same page.
When you give me a new task please email me with a breakdown in a list format.
I love tables - setting out a data task with the columns and rows you expect will help me get it right first time.
## When not at work...
I like sailing and playing the violin in a string quartet.
I am a member of Bristol Rail Campaign and present at their public meetings.
## The job and my background
I lead the data loading into an in-house Defra database on sustainable farming incentives (things like planting flowers and maintaining hedgerows)
I have a physics degree, PhD and four increasingly precarious postdocs before coming to Defra in 2024.
