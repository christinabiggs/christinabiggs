## Who I am
- Christina Biggs
- I live in Bristol
- Iâ€™m half-Swedish and half-English and have a twin brother.
## The job and my background
- Currently Data Engineer (HEO) at Defra, working 9.00am-3.00pm Monday to Friday (0.74FTE).
- I lead the data loading into an in-house Defra database on sustainable farming incentives (things like planting flowers and maintaining hedgerows)
- I have a physics degree, have a PhD and did four increasingly precarious postdocs before coming to Defra in 2024.
## My preferences
- I like to use Teams messages when discussing a task as that means I can add comments and findings (and edit them) and they are all on the same page.
- When you give me a new task please email me with a breakdown in a list format.
- I love tables - setting out a data task with the columns and rows you expect will help me get it right first time.
## When not at work...
- I like sailing - I am Vice-Commodore at Shirehampton Sailing Club and a Dinghy Instructor in the Sea Cadets.
- I play the violin and the viola, mostly classical, playing in a string quartet, sometimes sea shanties.
- I am a committee member of Bristol Rail Campaign, advocating for investment into local rail.
